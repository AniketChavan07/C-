// instance means in oops is object

oops in c++
to write a code in better way in  with the help of oops 
stl lib 
vector 
string 
stack
oops in 2 terms
1 object are entites in the real world
2 class is like a blueprint of these entites or group of object
syntax of class
class class_name{

};


// access modifiers

public : data and methods accessible to everyone

private : data and methods accessible inside class

protected : data and methods accessible inside class and to its derived class

// setter 

are use to set a private values

// getter 
are use to get a private values


// encapsulation
encapsulation is wrapping up of data and member function in a single unit called class

 there are 4 major pillars
 1 encapsulation
 2 abstraction
 3 inheritance
 4 polymorphism

 1 encapsulation
 class = data/properties + member function  
hide a sensitive data and information = private;


// constructor
special methods invoked automatically at time of object creation used for initialisation

.same name as class 
.constructor dosent have a return type
.only called once automatically at object creation
.memory allocation happens when constructor is called

// constructor are 2 type
1 non parametrized
2 parametrized
3 copy


// constructor 
this is a special pointer in c++ that points to the current object
this -> prop is same as *(this).prop

//copy constructor
special constructor default used to copy properties of one object into another
// shallow copy and deep copy
shallow copy means copy a one object to  another object 
issue in a shallow copy is dynamic memory allocation 
all dynamic memory allocation are in a heap memory

// deep copy
A deep copy on the other hand not only copies the member values but also makes copies of any dynamically allocated memory that the members point to


// destructor 
deallocation of a memory compiler it allocates a automatically but it deallocation only a staticly allocated memory

// three mode of inheritance

base class     derived class
              private mode       protected mode          public mode
public         private              protected               public
private          not inheriated     not inheriated          not inheriated
protected         private           protected               protected




type of inheritance

single inheritance               multilevel          multiple           heirarchal inheritance     hybrid inheritance

parent                              parent       parent  parent              parent
|                                     |                 |                   /     \
class                                parent            child               child  child
                                      |   
                                      class        

// inheritance is used for reusablity code
// when properties & member function of base class are passed on to the derived or child class                                               


// polymorphism
// poly = many
// morphism = forms
polymorphism is the abilit of object to take on different forms of behave in different ways depending on the context in which they are used 


.compile time polymorphism
.run time polymorphism


// abstraction
hiding all unnecessary details and showing only the important parts
acces modifiers are one of the way to implement a abstraction 

one more way to implement a abstraction
using abstraction classes
.abstract classes are used to provided a base class from which other class can be derived
.they cannot be instantiated(not to create a object) and are meant to be inheriated
.abstract classes are typically used to define an interfece for derived class


üîç GET
Purpose: Fetch data from the server.

Example: Get all books from a library.

Analogy: Reading a book ‚Äî you're just looking at it.

üìù POST
Purpose: Send data to the server to create something.

Example: Add a new book to the library.

Analogy: Donating a new book.

 PUT
Purpose: Update existing data on the server (full replacement).

Example: Update the details of an existing book.

Analogy: Rewriting a book and replacing it on the shelf.


üóëÔ∏è DELETE
Purpose: Delete data from the server.

Example: Remove a book from the library.

Analogy: Throwing away a book.
